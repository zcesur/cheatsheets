## Netlify CMS
To address some of the limitations of static websites, which tend to be less sophisticated and harder to use for the website maintainer than a dynamic content publishing solution such as WordPress or Medium, Netlify develops its own open source headless content management system called Netlify CMS.

## JAMstack
JAMstack, a cloud-native web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and markup, was pioneered and created by Netlify. In basic terms, JAMstack is a significant shift in focus from the now abstractable backend to the now powerful frontend

On July 10, 2018, GitHub founder and former CEO Tom Preston-Werner predicted that "within 5 years, you'll build your next large scale, fully featured web app with JAMstack and deploy on Netlify."
